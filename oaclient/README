The OAClient Library

This is a library written to separate out the OAuth specifics from the
SASL-OAUTH  stuff, and intended to become a standalone thing.  It 
implements a SQLite cache of user credentials per user that are shared
among all clients using the library.  This becomes important if you
have multiple processes/threads that all need to authenticate and you
only want to prompt the user once, so locking is handled through the
library. 

As such it's much like a Cyrus SASL plugin in that it takes callbaks
for I/O with the user so the UI layer is abstracted away.  This isn't
perfect but it made sense at the time.

Known issues:

1) There is no Windows port and all this stuff needs to eventually be
cross platform.

2) Locking relise on local filesystem locking, unknown if it will work
right on NFS or anything but a loclaly mounted disk.

3) Have not completely abstracted out the Cyrus SASL library yet I
think.  Need to work on that if this is to be independent.
